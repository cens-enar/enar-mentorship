Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "text": "ENAR Home Page\n  \n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the ENAR Mentoring Program!\nEstablished in 2025, the ENAR Mentoring Program connects prospective mentees within the ENAR community with more senior mentors for one-touch individualized mentoring sessions. Mentors span a wide range of experience, from seasoned leaders in the (bio)statistics field looking to support their junior colleagues to senior graduate students helping newer graduate students navigate their educational path.\nAt this time, we are actively recruiting mentors for our first cycle of one-touch mentorship in October 2025. Mentors are required to provide 3–4 time slots (of 30 minutes each) for which they are available to meet with a mentee in the month of October. These would be one-time meetings with no expectation of follow-up, and mentees will be asked to come prepared with a list of questions or discussion points. If you are interested in serving as a mentor, head over to our Get Involved page.\nMentees, stay tuned! Sign-up links will be available soon on our Get Involved page."
