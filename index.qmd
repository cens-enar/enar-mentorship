# Welcome to the ENAR Mentoring Program!

Established in 2025, the ENAR Mentoring Program connects prospective mentees within the ENAR community with more senior mentors for one-touch individualized mentoring sessions. Mentors span a wide range of experience, from seasoned leaders in the (bio)statistics field looking to support their junior colleagues to senior graduate students helping newer graduate students navigate their educational path.

At this time, we are actively recruiting **mentors** for our first cycle of one-touch mentorship in October 2025. Mentors are required to provide 3â€“4 time slots (of 30 minutes each) for which they are available to meet with a mentee in the month of October. These would be one-time meetings with no expectation of follow-up, and mentees will be asked to come prepared with a list of questions or discussion points. If you are interested in serving as a mentor, head over to our [Get Involved]() page.

Mentees, stay tuned! Sign-up links will be available soon on our [Get Involved]() page.
