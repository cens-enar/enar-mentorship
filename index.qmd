# Welcome to the ENAR Mentoring Program!

Established in 2025, the ENAR Mentoring Program connects prospective mentees within the ENAR community with more senior mentors for one-touch individualized mentoring sessions. Mentors span a wide range of experience, from seasoned leaders in the (bio)statistics field looking to support their junior colleagues to senior graduate students helping newer graduate students navigate their educational path.
